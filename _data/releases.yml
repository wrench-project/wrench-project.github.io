- version: 1.7
  date: September 17, 2020
  simgrid_version: 3.25
  description:
    - "Redesign of the WRENCH Dashboard: includes a number of graphs for visualizing the Gantt chart of the workflow execution, host utilization, network bandwidth usage, and energy consumption."
    - "Improvements to BareMetalComputeService: load is now equally distributed among hosts, and the service provides an API equivalent to the squeue Slurm command."
    - "Improvements to CloudComputeService: added a function to get the ComputeService for a VM based on its name."
    - "Improvements to VirtualizedClusterComputeService: added a function to get the physical host."
    - Enabled support for capturing network link's usage during the simulation.
    - "Improvements to Simulation JSON output: added disk read/write failures, and network link usage."
    - Added an exception handling for ensuring a link bandwidth in the platform file is not set to zero.
    - A number of bug fixes and small enhancements

- version: 1.6
  date: May 7, 2020
  simgrid_version: 3.25
  description:
    - "Refactored the WRENCH documentation: WRENCH 101 for users and WRENCH 102 for developers"
    - "New collection of examples provided with WRENCH distribution: Over 10 examples of simulators including cloud and batch computing, and a simulator for workflow processing"
    - "Removed dependency to Lemon library: We now use Boost, which is already used by SimGrid"
    - "Simulation logging in now disabled by default: In an attempt to reduce the verbosity of simulation outputs, detailed simulation output (i.e., services and components) have been disabled. Full logging can be enabled using the --wrench-full-log command line argument, or via fine-grained logging capabilities (see documentation)."
    - "Refactored the BatchComputeService class: Includes a conservative backfilling algorithm for validation purposes"
    - "Improvements to simulation output processing and JSON output: Now, WRENCH provides an option to generate simulation output into a single JSON file (includes: task, host, disk I/O, and energy information)"
    - Series of improvements to the WRENCH Dashboard
    - A number of bug fixes and small enhancements
